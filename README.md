# Zodify

WIP React project using Spotify API to generate an animal from the Vietnamese zodiac based on user's top listened to genres. 
Axios (promise based HTTP client for browser and Node.js) is used to call on the Spotify API in lieu of a backend (for now).
Formerly supported authentication through Google Firebase, though code is disabled for now (since there is no real purpose for it but may add more features in the future), solely relying on Spotify auth.

Node.js and node-postgres are used to retrieve data from the AWS RDS database in the backend.

This project was inspired by Receiptify by Michelle Liu and some of the initial code was based on CarmelleCodes' React JS series on Youtube.
