# Zodify

WIP React project using Spotify API to generate an animal from the Vietnamese zodiac based on user's top listened to genres. 
Axios (promise based HTTP client for browser and Node.js) is used to call on the Spotify API in lieu of a backend (for now).
Authentication provided through Google Firebase.

Node.js and node-postgres are used to retrieve data from the AWS RDS database in the backend.
