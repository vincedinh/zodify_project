          Zodify is an open source app used to generate an animal based on your Spotify top artists and the Vietnamese zodiac. <br/>

        <h3>Why is the app not working?</h3>
        <p>You may need to first log into the Spotify App by clicking the Spotify Login button on the home screen and allow permissions. <br/>
          If it is still not working, then try refreshing the page.

      <h3>How are zodiacs generated?</h3>
        <p>
          Zodify takes your top 10 artists and their associated genres from the Spotify API. <br/> 
          Using an algorithm based on your top genres, a zodiac is then assigned to your listening habits within the past month. <br/>
          Your top artists' genres are also weighed based on each artist's ranking on your top artist list. <br/>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Why did I get a different animal than the one of the year I was born in?</h3>
        <p>
          Rather than a direct astrological association (such as birth year), Zodify considers the traits of each animal and your listening habits. <br/>
          It then bases its results on symbolic connections between your top genres' vibes and each zodiac animal's traits according to the zodiac. <br/>
          Therefore, your music's zodiac animal can be different from month to month!

        <h3>Why is there a cat instead of the rabbit?</h3>
        <p>
          The zodiac used for Zodify is mostly based on the Vietnamese zodiac instead of the Chinese zodiac. <br/>
          Instead of the Rabbit and Ox, the Vietnamese zodiac instead honors the Cat and Water Buffalo respectively.
